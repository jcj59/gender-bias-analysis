# Gender Bias Analysis in the Workplace Simulation

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **gender bias in the workplace** using a **simulation-based approach** to model real-world workplace dynamics. The primary goal is to evaluate the impact of various factors and interventions on reducing gender disparities in hiring, promotions, and overall workforce representation.

Our simulation incorporates a range of factors that reflect realistic workplace scenarios and allows for experimentation with anti-bias interventions. The insights derived from this study aim to inform policies that can create a more equitable workplace.

## Approach and Methodology

### 1. **Simulation Model**
The simulation models the following factors that influence workplace dynamics:
- **Seniority**: Models career progression based on experience and tenure.
- **Performance Measures**: Accounts for bias in performance evaluations and their effects on promotions.
- **Homophily in Hiring and Promotion**: Simulates a preference for candidates of similar identities (e.g., same gender).
- **Networking**: Captures the impact of professional networks on promotion opportunities.
- **Departure Rates**: Models varying departure rates based on factors like parental leave and systemic bias.
<!-- - **Pay Gaps**: Includes salary disparities and their effect on retention. -->
- **Intersectionality**: Examines compounded biases faced by women of color and other intersecting identities.
- **Disengagement Rate**: Models how systemic bias affects employee retention.

### 2. **Anti-Bias Interventions**
Our model evaluates the effectiveness of the following anti-bias measures:
- **Blind Hiring**: Removes names and gender identifiers from resumes to neutralize bias.
- **Rooney Rule**: Ensures a gender-diverse pool of candidates for hiring and promotions.
- **Quotas**: Enforces minimum thresholds for gender representation at different levels.
- **Anti-Bias Training**: Models the decay of implicit bias in hiring and promotions over time.
- **Policy Changes**: Simulates the impact of flexible work policies and inclusive workplace culture.

## Research Questions
To answer our broad research question of what methods are the most effective for 
reducing bias in the workplace, we address the following key research questions:
### **Question 1**: What is the impact of Early-Stage vs. Late-Stage Anti-Bias Interventions
- **Setup**: Compare blind hiring (early-stage) with quotas and anti-bias training (late-stage).
- **Metrics**: Gender imbalance, time to equilibrium, fairness vs. efficiency trade-offs.

### **Experiment 2**: How Effective are Current Anti-Bias Measures (Quotas, Rooney Rule, and Blind Hiring)
- **Setup**: Evaluate each intervention individually and in combination.
- **Metrics**: Reduction in gender imbalance, fairness vs. efficiency, and time to equilibrium.

### **Experiment 3**: What is the Long-Term Impact of Anti-Bias Training
- **Setup**: Simulate bias decay over time with varying training frequencies and decay rates.
- **Metrics**: Sustainability of bias reduction, gender balance, and equilibrium time.

## Metrics
We measure the effectiveness of interventions using the following metrics:
1. **Reduction in Gender Imbalance**:
   - Measure the difference between current gender ratios and the ideal balance (e.g., 50%).
2. **Difference from Realistic Workforce Distribution**:
   - Compare simulation outcomes to real-world statistics from available datasets.
3. **Time to Equilibrium**:
   - Assess how quickly interventions lead to steady-state representation.
4. **Fairness vs. Efficiency Trade-Offs**:
   - Evaluate whether diversity efforts impact workforce qualifications.
